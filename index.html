  <h2> You got to get to know me. </h2>
  <p> My name is Kal-El and I was born on the planet <a href="page1.html">Krypton</a>,
    before being rocketed to Earth as an infant by my scientist father Jor-El, moments before Krypton's destruction.</p>
  <p> I was discovered and adopted by a Kansas farm couple, raised as Clark Kent, and imbued with a strong moral compass.</p>
  <p> Very early on I started to display various superhuman abilities, which, upon reaching maturity, I resolved to use for the benefit of humanity through a secret "Superman" identity.</p>
  
  <h2> Where  you'll find me. </h2>
  <p> I reside and operate in the American city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(comics)"> Metropolis </a>
  as a journalist for the Daily Planet.</p>

<h1> In my world </h1>
<p> Named after the element krypton, which is abundant in its atmosphere, this is where I was born. </p>
<img src="krypton.jpg"/>
<p> Krypton exploded as a result of a nuclear chain reaction caused by the planet's unstable radioactive core. But before that 
the planet is believed to be inhabited by brilliant minds possessing supernatural powers. </p>
<p> Unfortunately all the civilizations and races of my world perished in the explosion, with one exception: Me who was placed in 
an escape rocket by my father, Jor-El, and sent to the planet Earth, where I grew up to become Clark Kent. </p>
<p> Krypton was shown to have been a planet similar to Earth, only older by eons and possessed of all the beneficial progress that 
implied (though the downside was the hint that Krypton exploded due mainly to old age). </p>
